# Contributing

For features or fixes, I would suggest to submit an issue first before submitting a pull request. This avoids closed pull-requests; useless work.

At the end of the day, just feel free to inquire for anything!

## Building

You are not required to build the library from source because the build files are already provided. This is *strictly* for contributors of experienced developers only.

##### Requirements

- [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

Just **clone the repository**, and you're good to go.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/srph/str-concat.js.git
```

##### Automation

```bash
$ npm test # run tests
$ npm run uglify # uglify the script (for production)
```
