# FAQ

### Does this library support CommonJS, AMD, and browser-globals?

Yes. This library consumes [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd/blob/master/returnExports.js).

## Why is this named as `srph-str-concat` instead of `str-concat` in package managers?

I don't see the reason why I should be using `str-concat`.
